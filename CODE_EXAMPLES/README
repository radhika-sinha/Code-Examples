# Assignment 3

I decided to leave in the MakeNull function because it makes
sense to have it for any implementation of a Graph, but got
rid of all the other unrequired functions from this assignment
because they were specific to the BFS function in a graph, which
was not needed here.

I chose to make the time variable local to DFS() and passed the
address to Visit(), making it an input-output variable because
was a simple and recommended way to approach this issue.

- List.c: implementation of List ADT
- List.h: header for List ADT
- Graph.c: implementation of Graph ADT
- Graph.h: header for Graph ADT
- GraphTest.c: test file used while creating Graph ADT
- FindComponents.c: main file to find strong components
- Makefile: used to build/clean the program, check for memory leaks

# Building

To build this program, run:

...
$ make
...

# Running

To run the programs:

...
$./FindComponents [infile] [outfile]
...

[infile]           Specifies the input file
[outfile]          Specifies the output file

# Cleaning

To remove all object files and executables, run:

...
$ make clean
...
